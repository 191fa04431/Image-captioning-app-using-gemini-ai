# Image-To-Text Using Gemini AI

Welcome to the **Image-To-Text-Using-Gemini AI** project! This repository demonstrates how to extract text from images using the powerful **Gemini AI** model integrated with **Google Colab**. The Generative AI model used here is **gemini-1.5-flash-latest**, and image processing is done using the **Pillow** library.

## Project Overview

This project provides a streamlined way to convert images to text using **Google's Gemini AI** model. The process involves using the `pillow` library to handle image processing and **Google Generative AI** to perform text extraction from the images.

---

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to install the following:

- **Google Generative AI** package: [google-generativeai](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/)
- **Pillow** for image processing: [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

Ensure you are using **Google Colab** for the execution of the notebook, as this platform provides a great environment for seamless integration with Gemini AI.

---

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can simply run the following commands in your Colab notebook or environment:

```bash
!pip install google-generativeai
from PIL import Image
```

Make sure to import the **PIL** library after installation to manage image processing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-To-Text-Using-Gemini-AI.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the installation section.

3. Upload your image and modify the code in the notebook to use your Gemini API key and model for text extraction.

4. Run the code, and you'll get the extracted text output.

---

## API Key Setup

You will need a **Gemini API Key** to access the Generative AI model. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your API key.
2. Copy the key and store it securely.
3. Update your Colab notebook with the API key to authenticate access to the **gemini-1.5-flash-latest** model.
